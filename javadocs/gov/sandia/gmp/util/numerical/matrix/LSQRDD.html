<div class="block"><p> LSQR least-squares matrix solution algorithm as originally defined by
 for ACM TOMS as Algorithm 583 in 1982. This algorithm has undergone
 several modifications over the years including this translation to the
 Java programming language which includes a multi-threaded solution of
 the bidiagonalization operation (primarily function aProd).

 <p> Besides a general clean-up of the syntax this rendition also added a
 different way of outputting information. The new method allows the user to
 define a BufferedWriter into which LSQR output is written. This object
 must be set (see public void setWriter(BufferedWriter writer)) if that
 option is selected or an exception will be thrown. Output options include
 "None", "Screen", "Writer", and "Screen & Writer". The default is "Screen"
 but each can be selected using one of the following functions:
 
   public void setOutputNone();
   public void setOutputScreen();
   public void setOutputWriter();
   public void setOutputScreenAndWriter();
 
 <p> In addition to output all of the standard output normalization, condition
 numbers, and limits can be retrieved following the solution. These retrieval
 functions include:

   public double aNorm();
   public double arNorm();
   public double bNorm();
   public double xNorm();
   public double aCond();
   public double systemCompatibilityMeasure();
   public double LeastSquaresAccuracyMeasure();
   public double aTol();
   public double bTol();
   public double damp();
   
   public int stopCondition();
   public int iterationLimit();
   public int conditionLimit();

   public int iterationCount();
   public int matrixRows();
   public int matrixCols();

 <p> On input aTol, bTol, damp, iterationLimit, and conditionLimit can all
 be set before calling solve.

 <p> The primary function call is:
 
 <p>     public int solve(ArrayList<SparseMatrixVector> sprsRow,
                          ArrayList<SparseMatrixVector> sprsCol,
                          ArrayListDouble bRHS, double[] x, double[] se)
                    throws IOException

 <p> The vector bRHS is the rhs vector of the problem definition, x is the
 solution vector and se is the solution error. Both x and se are solved for and
 filled on return. The lists sprsRow and sprsCol are lists of row-ordered and
 column-ordered sparse matrix vectors, respectively. The primary solution
 calculation can be performed entirely are partly in a concurrent parallel
 mode. The SolveType setting for parallel concurrency can take on any of the
 eight values, NONE, SCALE, NORM, APROD, SCALE_NORM, SCALE_APROD, NORM_APROD,
 or SCALE_NORM_APROD. The setting determines which part, if any, is performed
 using parallel concurrency.
 
 <p> Similarly, the DoubleDouble SolveType setting can be set in the same
 fashion as the parallel concurrency setting, to perform any part of the
 calculation using DoubleDouble precision.
 
 <p> The default parallel and DoubleDouble calculation settings are
     aUseParallel     = SolveType.NORM_SCALE_APROD;
     aUseDoubleDouble = SolveType.NORM_SCALE;
 
 <p> The original analytic description of the solution methodology follows:
 ****************************************************************************

 <p> LSQR  finds a solution x to the following problems:

 <p> 1. Unsymmetric equations --    solve  A*x = b

 <p> 2. Linear least squares  --    solve  A*x = b
                                    in the least-squares sense

 <p> 3. Damped least squares  --    solve  (   A    )*x = ( b )
                                           ( damp*I )     ( 0 )
                                    in the least-squares sense

 <p> where A is a matrix with m rows and n columns, b is an
     m-vector, and damp is a scalar.  (All quantities are real.)
     The matrix A is intended to be large and sparse.  It is used
     in function aprod to update v and u as
     
 <p>            u[sprsRowIndx[i]] += aSprs[i] * v[sprsColIndx[i]];
                
 <p>            (effectively y = y + A * x) or as

 <p>            v[sprsColIndx[i]] += aSprs[i] * u[sprsRowIndx[i]];
                
 <p>            (which is x = x + A' * y).

 <p> The rhs vector b is input via u, and subsequently overwritten.

 <p> Note:  LSQR uses an iterative method to approximate the solution.
     The number of iterations required to reach a certain accuracy
     depends strongly on the scaling of the problem.  Poor scaling of
     the rows or columns of A should therefore be avoided where
     possible.

 <p> For example, in problem 1 the solution is unaltered by
     row-scaling.  If a row of A is very small or large compared to
     the other rows of A, the corresponding row of ( A  b ) should be
     scaled up or down.

 <p> In problems 1 and 2, the solution x is easily recovered
     following column-scaling.  Unless better information is known,
     the nonzero columns of A should be scaled so that they all have
     the same Euclidean norm (e.g., 1.0).

 <p> In problem 3, there is no freedom to re-scale if damp is
     nonzero.  However, the value of damp should be assigned only
     after attention has been paid to the scaling of A.

 <p> The parameter damp is intended to help regularize
     ill-conditioned systems, by preventing the true solution from
     being very large.  Another aid to regularization is provided by
     the parameter lsqrACond, which may be used to terminate iterations
     before the computed solution becomes very large.


 <p> Notation
     --------

 <p> The following quantities are used in discussing the subroutine
     parameters:

 <p> Abar   =  (   A    ),          bbar  =  ( b )
               ( damp*I )                    ( 0 )

 <p> r      =  b  -  A*x,           rbar  =  bbar  -  Abar*x

 <p> rnorm  =  sqrt( norm(r)**2  +  damp**2 * norm(x)**2 )
            =  norm( rbar )

 <p> RELPR  =  the relative precision of floating-point arithmetic
               on the machine being used. (typically near 1.0e-16
               on modern machines in double precision).

 <p> LSQR  minimizes the function rnorm with respect to x.


 <p> Parameters
     ----------

 <p> lsqrRows input      The number of rows in A. Taken from u.length.

 <p> lsqrCols input      The number of columns in A. Taken from x.length.

 <p> damp     input      The damping parameter for problem 3 above.
                         (damp should be 0.0 for problems 1 and 2.)
                         If the system A*x = b is incompatible, values
                         of damp in the range 0 to sqrt(RELPR)*norm(A)
                         will probably have a negligible effect.
                         Larger values of damp will tend to decrease
                         the norm of x and reduce the number of
                         iterations required by LSQR.

 <p>                     The work per iteration and the storage needed
                         by LSQR are the same for all values of damp.

 <p> u(nrow)  input      The rhs vector b.  Beware that u is
                         over-written by LSQR.

 <p> x(ncol)  output     Returns the computed solution x.

 <p> se(ncol) output     Returns standard error estimates for the
                         components of X.  For each i, SE(i) is set
                         to the value  rnorm * sqrt( sigma(i,i) / T ),
                         where sigma(i,i) is an estimate of the i-th
                         diagonal of the inverse of Abar(transpose)*Abar
                         and  T = 1      if  m .le. n,
                              T = m - n  if  m .gt. n  and  damp = 0,
                              T = m      if  damp .ne. 0.

 <p> lsqrATol  input     An estimate of the relative error in the data
                         defining the matrix A.  For example,
                         if A is accurate to about 6 digits, set
                         lsqrATol = 1.0e-6 (default). Set / returned
                         with function aTol().

 <p> lsqrBTol  input     An extimate of the relative error in the data
                         defining the rhs vector b.  For example,
                         if b is accurate to about 6 digits, set
                         lsqrBTol = 1.0e-6 (default). Set / returned
                         with function bTol().

 <p> lsqrConLim  input   An upper limit on cond(Abar), the apparent
                         condition number of the matrix Abar.
                         Iterations will be terminated if a computed
                         estimate of cond(Abar) exceeds conLim.
                         This is intended to prevent certain small or
                         zero singular values of A or Abar from
                         coming into effect and causing unwanted growth
                         in the computed solution.

 <p>                     conLim and damp may be used separately or
                         together to regularize ill-conditioned systems.

 <p>                     Normally, conLim should be in the range
                         1000 to 1/RELPR.
                         Suggested value:
                         conLim = 1/(100*RELPR)  for compatible systems,
                         conLim = 1/(10*sqrt(RELPR)) for least squares.

 <p>                     Set / returned with function condLimit().

 <p>          Note:  If the user is not concerned about the parameters
              lsqrATol, lsqrBTol and conLim, any or all of them may be set
              to zero.  The effect will be the same as the values
              RELPR, RELPR and 1/RELPR respectively.

 <p> lsqrItnLim  input   An upper limit on the number of iterations.
                         Suggested value:
                         lsqrItnLim = n/2  for well-conditioned systems
                                           with clustered singular values,
                         lsqrItnLim = 4*n  otherwise.
                         Set / returned with function iterationLimit().

 <p> lsqrIStop  output   An integer giving the reason for termination
                         (returned by function solve(...) and function
                          stopCondition()):

 <p>             0       x = 0  is the exact solution.
                         No iterations were performed.

 <p>             1       The equations A*x = b are probably
                         compatible.  Norm(A*x - b) is sufficiently
                         small, given the values of lsqrATol and lsqrBTol.

 <p>             2       The system A*x = b is probably not
                         compatible.  A least-squares solution has
                         been obtained that is sufficiently accurate,
                         given the value of lsqrATol.

 <p>             3       An estimate of cond(Abar) has exceeded
                         conLim.  The system A*x = b appears to be
                         ill-conditioned. There could be an inconsistency
                         in the sparse matrix or indirect index arrays
                         (aSprs, indxMSprs, indxDSprs).

 <p>             4       The equations A*x = b are probably
                         compatible.  Norm(A*x - b) is as small as
                         seems reasonable on this machine.

 <p>             5       The system A*x = b is probably not
                         compatible.  A least-squares solution has
                         been obtained that is as accurate as seems
                         reasonable on this machine.

 <p>             6       Cond(Abar) seems to be so large that there is
                         no point in doing further iterations,
                         given the precision of this machine. There could
                         be an inconsistency in the sparse matrix or
                         indirect index arrays (aSprs, indxMSprs, indxDSprs).

 <p>             7       The iteration limit lsqrItnLim was reached.
 
 <p> lsqrIter    output  The number of iterations performed. Accessed
                         from function iterationCount().

 <p> lsqrANorm   output  An estimate of the Frobenius norm of  Abar.
                         This is the square-root of the sum of squares
                         of the elements of Abar.
                         If "damp" is small and if the columns of A
                         have all been scaled to have length 1.0,
                         lsqrANorm should increase to roughly sqrt(n).
                         A radically different value for lsqrANorm may
                         indicate an error in in the sparse
                         matrix or indirect index arrays (aSprs,
                         indxMSprs, indxDSprs). Accessed from function
                         aNorm().

 <p> lsqrACond   output  An estimate of cond(Abar), the condition
                         number of Abar.  A very high value of lsqrACond
                         may indicate an inconsistency in the sparse
                         matrix or indirect index arrays (aSprs,
                         indxMSprs, indxDSprs). Accessed from function
                         aCond().

 <p> lsqrRNorm   output  An estimate of the final value of norm(rbar),
                         the function being minimized (see notation
                         above).  This will be small if A*x = b has
                         a solution. Accessed from function rNorm().

 <p> lsqrARNorm  output  An estimate of the final value of
                         norm( Abar(transpose)*rbar ), the norm of
                         the residual for the usual normal equations.
                         This should be small in all cases.  (lsqrARNorm
                         will often be smaller than the true value
                         computed from the output vector X.) Accessed
                         from function arNorm().

 <p> lsqrXNorm   output  An estimate of the norm of the final
                         solution vector X. Accessed from function
                         xNorm().

 <p> LSQR development:
     22 Feb 1982: LSQR sent to ACM TOMS to become Algorithm 583.
     15 Sep 1985: Final F66 version.  LSQR sent to "misc" in netlib.
     13 Oct 1987: Bug (Robert Davies, DSIR).  Have to delete
                     IF ( (1.0 + DABS(T)) .LE. 1.0) GO TO 200
                  from loop 200.  The test was an attempt to reduce
                  underflows, but caused W(I) not to be updated.
     17 Mar 1989: First F77 version.
     04 May 1989: Bug (David Gay, AT&T).  When the second beta is zero,
                  lsqrRNorm = 0 and
                  TEST2 = lsqrARNorm / (lsqrANorm * lsqrRNorm) overflows.
                  Fixed by testing for lsqrRNorm = 0.
     05 May 1989: Sent to "misc" in netlib.
     24 Mar 2008: Converted to Java (James R Hipp, Sandia National
                  Laboratories).
     28 Aug 2009: Added multi-threaded solution of aProd (James R Hipp,
                  Sandia National Laboratories).
