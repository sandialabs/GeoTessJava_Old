/**
 * <b>GeoTessModel</b> manages the <i>grid</i> and <i>data</i> that comprise a
 * 3D Earth model. The Earth is assumed to be composed of a number of
 * <i>layers</i> each of which spans the entire geographic extent of the Earth.
 * It is assumed that layer boundaries do not fold back on themselves, i.e.,
 * along any radial profile through the model, each layer boundary is
 * intersected exactly one time. Layers may have zero thickness over some or all
 * of their geographic extent. Earth properties stored in the model are assumed
 * to be continuous within a layer, both geographically and radially, but may be
 * discontinuous across layer boundaries.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A <b>GeoTessModel</b> is comprised of 4 major components:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The model <i>grid</i> (<i>geometry</i> and <i>topology</i>) is managed by
 * a <b>GeoTessGrid</b> object. The grid is made up of one or more 2D triangular
 * tessellations of a unit sphere.
 * 
 * <li>The <i>data</i> are managed by a 2D array of <b>Profile</b> objects. A
 * <b>Profile</b> is essentially a list of radii and <b>Data</b> objects
 * distributed along a radial profile that spans a single layer at a single
 * vertex of the 2D grid. The 2D Profile array has dimensions nVertices by
 * nLayers.
 * 
 * <li>Important metadata about the model, such as the names of the major
 * layers, the names of the data attributes stored in the model, etc., are
 * managed by a <b>GeoTessMetaData</b> object.
 * 
 * <li>PointMap facilitates accessing information in the model by providing a
 * map between point indexes, vertex indexes, layer indexes and node indexes.
 * See documentation for PointMap for more information.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * 
 * There are many different indexes used to access information:
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>vertex</i> refers to a position in the 2D tessellation. They are 2D
 * positions represented by unit vectors on a unit sphere. Vertices are managed
 * in the GeoTessGrid object which can be accessed via model.getGrid().
 * <li><i>layer</i> refers to one of the layers in the model, such as the core,
 * mantle or crust. Layers are defined in the GeoTessMetaData object which can
 * be accessed from model.getMetaData().
 * <li><i>node</i> refers to a Data object on a radial Profile associated with a
 * vertex and a layer in the model. Node indexes are unique only within a given
 * Profile (all Profile have a node with index 0 for example).
 * <li><i>point</i> refers to all the nodes in all the Profiles of the model.
 * There is only one 'point' in the model with index 0.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * PointMap is introduced to help manage all these different indexes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * GeoTessModel is thread-safe in that its internal state is ony modified in
 * synchronized methods after its data has been loaded into memory. The design
 * intention is that single instances of a GeoTessModel object can be shared
 * among all the threads in a multi-threaded application and each thread will
 * have it's own instance of a GeoTessPosition object that references the common
 * GeoTessModel.
