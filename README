GeoTessJava is a model parameterization for multi-dimensional Earth models 
and an extendable software system that implements the construction, population, 
storage and interrogation of data stored in the model.

GeoTessJava is delivered with the following components:

- A license agreement.

- GeoTessUsersManual.pdf

- Source code

- A pom.xml file which can be used with Maven (https://maven.apache.org) 
  to rebuild the jar file from the source code.

- A precompiled jar file: target/geotess-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar. 
  This jar file can be run as a a standalone application or can be used as a 
  library in user-developed java applications.  The jar was compiled with 
  java JDK version 10.

- Run-scripts geotess.sh and geotessbuilder.sh.  User's will likely have to 
  edit some paths defined in the run scripts to point to correct locations 
  on their systems.
